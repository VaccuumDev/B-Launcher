## For Developers

If you want to build your own launcher based on B-Launcher:

- The project uses **.NET** and can be built using the `dotnet` CLI:
```sh
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

- The code follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern to separate UI from business logic, making it clean and maintainable.
- A special developer module is included but hidden by default to facilitate advanced features and debugging without cluttering the main user interface.
- Feel free to fork and customize the launcher for your own projects!
